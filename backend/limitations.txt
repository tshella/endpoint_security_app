Limitations
Static Detection Capabilities:

The threat detection relies on static patterns and signatures. This can be less effective against unknown threats (zero-day attacks) and advanced persistent threats (APTs).
No Real-Time Update Mechanism:

Without integration with real-time threat intelligence feeds or machine learning models, the app may struggle to adapt to new threats dynamically.
Limited Scalability and Distributed Monitoring:

The app currently operates in a standalone mode, with no inherent ability to monitor across multiple distributed environments (e.g., a network of devices).
No Advanced User Behavior Analysis:

User behavior analytics is limited. Advanced behavior analysis, potentially enhanced with AI/ML, could provide deeper insights and more robust anomaly detection.
No Centralized Reporting or Dashboard:

There is no graphical interface or centralized dashboard for security analysts to view incidents, track statistics, or manage configurations.

Potential Enhancements
Integration with Machine Learning Models:

Machine learning can help detect anomalies and unknown threats by analyzing patterns and identifying unusual behavior. Models could be trained on network traffic, user behavior, and more.
Real-Time Threat Intelligence Integration:

Integrate real-time threat intelligence feeds (e.g., from APIs like VirusTotal or paid threat intelligence providers) to continuously update the threat signature database.
Advanced User Behavior Analytics:

Implement algorithms to analyze user behavior more deeply, helping to detect internal threats or compromised accounts.
Centralized Dashboard:

Create a web-based or desktop dashboard to visualize threats, monitor network and user activities, and manage alerts. This would make it easier for security personnel to interact with the application.
Logging and Forensic Analysis:

Add detailed logging and forensic tools to help security analysts investigate incidents after detection.
Improved Password Management:

Extend the password generation utility with a password manager that securely stores and retrieves passwords for users.
Cross-Platform Support:

Adapt the code to make it cross-platform, ensuring it can be deployed on various operating systems beyond Windows.
Integrating Blockchain for Enhanced Security
Blockchain can be integrated into the app to enhance security, transparency, and integrity. Here are a few ideas:

Immutable Audit Logs:

Store audit logs on a blockchain for immutability. This would ensure that all security events, including breaches, access requests, and permissions changes, are recorded in an unalterable ledger. This feature would improve the forensic investigation and provide an indisputable record.
Distributed Threat Intelligence:

Use a blockchain network to share threat intelligence data across organizations securely. Participating entities can contribute threat signatures or hash patterns of known malicious files, creating a decentralized repository of threats.
Decentralized Identity Management:

Implement a blockchain-based identity management system to verify user identities and permissions. This would make it harder for unauthorized users to access sensitive information or services, as identities could be verified across multiple trusted nodes.
Smart Contracts for Automated Responses:

Use smart contracts to automate specific actions based on predefined conditions. For example, if a breach is detected, a smart contract could trigger an alert to all relevant parties, initiate an automatic lockdown of sensitive systems, or even revoke permissions temporarily.
Secure Data Exchange with Blockchain-Based Encryption:

Blockchain could be used to secure data exchanges by storing and verifying cryptographic keys and ensuring that data integrity is maintained across all nodes in the network.
